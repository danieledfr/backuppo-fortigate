# Backuppo
## Simple platform for backup a FortiGate appliances through RestAPI


Backuppo is a web-based application created with the simple idea ( for my needs ) of saving a FortiGate configuration using a secure method.

Few things to keep in mind:
- I'm not developer and i have ZERO programming skills, i'm very able to do copy / paste. ( Maybe i can make it appear an "Hello World" message on a linux terminal )
- I used my friend ChatGPT to do that.
- I know, i don't think is a quality code.
- Apparently seems to be working!

## Features

- Save a FortiGate configurations in secure mode. RestAPI with HTTPS secure communication
- Schedule a cron to plan when do the backup. ( Daily, Weekly or Monthly )
- Download the last backupped configuration
- View the job's log
- All the features are able to do through web interface

I appreciate if someone want to introduce new features, fixing or something else...

Anyway, if you have the same needs to me, just download and use it!
